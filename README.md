![image_alt]()

## Background
As part of my cloud and DevOps engineering journey, I wanted to build a real-world CI/CD pipeline that showcases my ability to:
1.Provision infrastructure as code using **Terraform**
2.Set up a secure, scalable container deployment using **AWS ECS Fargate**
3.Automate testing and deployment using **GitHub Actions**

This project demonstrates a production-ready deployment pipeline for a Java application using modern DevOps practices and tools.
